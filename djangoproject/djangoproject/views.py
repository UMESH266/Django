* To render html web pages

* As per Django Documentation, A view function is a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. 
This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, a redirect, a 404 error, an XML document, an image, or anything 
that a web browser can display.

Django views are part of the user interface â€” they usually render the HTML/CSS/Javascript in your Template files into what
you see in your browser when you render a web page.
